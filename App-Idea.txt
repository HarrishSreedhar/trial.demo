What does the app do? : Connects quiz enthusiasts and gives them a space for sharing and accessing details about 
upcoming quiz events in their city

Motivation: A web application that lets quizzers disseminate information about quizzes they're hosting will help 
save a lot of time, as they won't need to spend time trawling various Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, 
and generic cultual-event websites for details about quizzes.

Functionality:
In addition to generic pages that let users log in / register, the app will have 3 main screens that encompass 
the following functionalities:

1.Add details of a quiz you're hosting. This will include venue, date and time,
  topic of the quiz (like 'Sports', 'Science and Technology', 'Business', etc), number of members allowed per team, 
  prize money, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Select a city and view details about
 quizzes happening there in the next two months.
 In addition to the details of the quiz, you will also be able to view the user profile of the person who added that quiz
 (name, organization, number of quizzes he / she has hosted in the past).
 Quizzes hosted by experienced hosts (rank by number of quizzes hosted) will be displayed at the top.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. A sticky list that allows users to save their favourite quizzes in the form of annotated Slideshare links.
 Slideshare has a large repository of quizzes uploaded by people who conduct quizzes, and this feature of the web-app will allow users to maintain a personal list 
of their favourite quizzes, with the option to add annotations if needed.
